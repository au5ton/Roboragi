# Roborugi
Roborugi is a Telegram bot (based off of [/u/Roboragi](https://www.reddit.com/user/Roboragi/)) which creates anime and manga links from MAL when requested. Some of the code may be plagiarized from the original project, as this is ultimately a crude port. To reflect that, this project is a fork of the original and is prominently visible.

## Technical info
Roborugi is written in node.js and I will detail the running environment for this later.
