    synopsis: 'After dying a laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a gam
e, high school student and recluse Kazuma Satou finds himself sitting before a beautiful bu
t obnoxious goddess named Aqua. She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heav
en or reincarnate in every gamer&#039;s dream&mdash;a real fantasy world! Choosing to start
 a new life, Kazuma is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villag
es. But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the
 future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistake&mdash;Aqua is completely use
less!\n\r\n\n\r\nUnfortunately, their troubles don&#039;t end here; it turns out that livin
g in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a t
hrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. Indeed, their
 misfortunes have only just begun!\n\r\n\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]',
